Simple web applictaion to fetch and parse data from the polygon.io options API using polygon.io's client-js library.

You must use your own polygon.io API key as shown in dummy_utils.js (really you need to create your own file named 'src/utils.js' with your API key).

BUILD: execute "npm run prod" in terminal then open dist/index.html in a browser (preferably Google Chrome / Chromium)

TODO:
    - prevent overlapping requests by user if I want to make this a big boy application
