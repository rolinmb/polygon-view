Simple node.js program to fetch and parse data from the polygon.io API using polygon.io's js client library.

You must use your own polygon.io API key as shown in dummy_utils.js (really you should create your own file named 'src/utils.js').

To run in terminal: node src/main.js (will not work with ApexCharts functionality left uncommented; reccommend to build then open dist/index.html in Google Chrome)

To build with Webpack into dist: npm run prod
