Simple web applictaion to fetch and parse data from the polygon.io options API using polygon.io's client-js library.

You must use your own polygon.io API key as shown in dummy_utils.js (really you need to create your own file named 'src/utils.js' with your API key).

To run in terminal: node src/main.js (will not work with ApexCharts functionality left uncommented; recommend to build then open dist/index.html in Google Chrome)

To build src/main.js with Webpack into dist/app.js: npm run prod
